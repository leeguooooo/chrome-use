# Changelog

## 1.5.111

<!-- release:start -->
### New Features

- **Local action context:** Interactive snapshots retain bounded nearby text, including product prices, alongside action controls. Semantic items, heading groups, and unambiguous linked product cards are supported. Repeated context on product links is omitted (#246).
- **Profile rules:** Opening a site can use existing ChooseBrowser rules to select a connected Chrome profile. Explicit `--browser` takes precedence; `--no-choosebrowser` disables rule lookup. An unavailable rule target falls back to normal profile selection, so verify account identity when needed (#247).

### Bug Fixes

- **Status receipts:** Interactive snapshots and action observations retain status text, including cart confirmations. Clickable status elements keep their action references (#246).
- **Drag routing:** Launched browsers choose their drag path from their own connection, even when another Chrome profile has an extension relay running (#246).

### Improvements

- Context output prioritizes short fields, marks truncation, and preserves references through budgeted continuation. Iframe expansion accepts references with additional metadata (#246).
- Release version and changelog validation run before the platform build matrix (#249).

## 1.5.109

### Bug Fixes

- **Action outcomes:** Relay recovery no longer automatically repeats an action whose result is unknown. Errors distinguish uncertain execution from a confirmed rejection (#242).
- **Observation quality:** Failed before/after captures no longer fabricate an empty page or removed elements. Responses preserve the action result and report complete, partial, or unavailable observations (#242).
- **Relay recovery:** Child-frame errors preserve healthy parent connections, recovered tab aliases target the replacement tab, and protected extension content produces an explicit access error (#242).
- **Connection status:** Bundled ab-connect 0.5.22 confirms the native host connection before showing Connected and ignores stale connection callbacks. Chrome Web Store distribution is separate (#242).
- **Session locks:** Lifecycle locks are explicitly released so a forked child retaining the descriptor does not delay subsequent commands (#242).

### Improvements

- Observation request summaries are bounded, retain omission counts, and appear in text output even without a DOM change. Full records remain available through `network requests --json` (#242).
- Added `CHROME_USE_RELAY_DIR` for isolated relay discovery. Relative paths are rejected instead of silently using a different registry (#242).
- Navigation detects confirmed debugger access denial while retaining normal page-load waits (#242).

## 1.5.101

### Bug Fixes

- **File upload confirmation:** React dropzones that consume and clear or replace their file input now return success with a verification warning instead of a false rejection (#208).
- **Controlled selects:** Native selects use platform setters and dispatch both input and change events so controlled forms commit the selection (#209).
- **Idle session preservation:** Idle daemon recycling preserves external Chrome tabs, URLs and in-page state. Explicit close and session stop still clean up created tabs (#210).
- **Relay navigation:** ab-connect 0.5.20 uses browser-level navigation first and reports rapid same-URL reload loops with recovery guidance. App Store Connect still needs a signed-in site regression check (#211).

### Improvements

- Added browser-backed upload and select regression tests and extension navigation/reload-loop tests.
- Updated command help, agent guidance, and English/Chinese documentation.
